# Hello, World — x86/x64 Assembly (MASM)

This repository contains two simple "Hello, World" programs written in assembly language using MASM and the Win32 API. One is 32-bit (386), the other is 64-bit.
Additionally, it includes a fairly simple, but fairly multi-purpose, INVOKE macro for 64-bit MASM. This macro supports up to 16 arguments and works with the Windows x64 ABI.
Note that the build scripts should be run from the x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS (when using x86) and the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS (when using x64).
